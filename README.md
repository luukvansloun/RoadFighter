## Rules

- Drive as fast as possible towards the finish line! Your score depends on the speed with which you drive.
- Don't drive into other cars, as points will be deducted if you crash.
    - Yellow Pick-Up Trucks will slow you down and a collision will push you in the direction of it. If you hit the side of the road whilst slowing down, you will surely crash.
    - White Lorries and your Blue Opponent Cars will make you crash, so avoid them at all cost.
- You can shoot your way through the other cars, but keep in mind, there's only 30 bullets at your disposal, so use them wisely (you might need them later on).
    - Yellow Pick-Up Trucks require 2 direct hits with a bullet to explode.
    - White Lorries and Blue Opponent Cars require 3 direct hits with a bullet to explode.
- Make sure to overtake all your opponents, as your score depends on your placement as well.
